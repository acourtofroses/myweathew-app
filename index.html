        <strong>House of the Dragon</strong> is an American fantasy drama
        television series. A independent prequel to Game of Thrones (2011â€“2019),
        it is the second show in the franchise, created by
        <em>George R. R. Martin and Ryan Condal</em>
        for HBO. Both series are based on the A Song of Ice and Fire novels by
        Martin. Condal and Miguel Sapochnik are the showrunners. Based on parts
        of the novel Fire & Blood, the series is set about 200 years before the
        events of Game of Thrones, 172 years before the birth of Daenerys
        Targaryen, descendant of the eponymous royal house, and 100 years after
        the Seven Kingdoms is united by the Targaryen Conquest. It portrays the
        beginning of the end of House Targaryen, the events leading up to and
        covering the Targaryen Civil war of succession, known as the "Dance of
        the Dragons".
